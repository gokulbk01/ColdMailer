# ColdMailer

In today’s job market, writing the right referral email or cold pitch can be the difference between a foot in the door and being ignored. So I decided to do something about it.

Over the weekend, I built a lightweight AI agent network that helps you write:

🧠 Referral emails (based on job description + your resume)

📩 Cold emails for potential clients (using their LinkedIn/Insta posts)

💼 Cover letters (personalized, not generic)

🚀 Pitches to investors (tailored to their latest interests and thesis)

It’s powered by LLMs (OpenAI, n8n), some clever prompting, and a lot of “what if I could automate this too” moments.

This is a beta version — still rough around the edges, but it works. And it’s open for roasts, feedback, and feature suggestions from anyone building or using AI tools.
